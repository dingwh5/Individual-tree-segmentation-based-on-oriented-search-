This document provides an overview of the code and instructions for its usage. The code is designed for single-tree segmentation based on point clouds. It includes two main processes: Oriednted Search and Clustering and Validity Checking and Points Updating. Below are the detailed descriptions and guidelines for running the code.
#1. Dependencies
The following software libraries are required to run the code:
-PCL (Point Cloud Library): Version 1.11, for point cloud data processing.
-OpenCV: Version 4.2, for visualization and related operations.
Ensure these libraries are properly installed and configured on your system before running the code.
#2. Code Structure
The code folder contains the following files:
-Code.cpp: The main source file containing the implementation of the algorithm.
-CMakeLists.txt: A configuration file for building the project using CMake.
Key configurable parameters in the source code:
-Line 558: Set the input folder path for point cloud files (format: .pcd).
-Line 606: Define the search radius (Radius) for clustering operations.

#3. Benchmark Data Source Statement
We have used two benchmark datasets in this project: NEWFOR (Eysn et al. 2015) and FORinstance (Puliti et al. 2023) .

#4. Generated Output Files
For each input point cloud, the program generates five output files, which are divided into two main stages:
##Stage 1: Oriednted Search and Clustering
-_cha: Contains the XYZ coordinates and classification of each point.
-_cha_point: Includes XYZ coordinates, classification, and RGB color of each point. Points belonging to the same tree share the same color.
-_cha_lei: Contains the XYZ coordinates of the top point (tree apex) for each tree.
##Stage 2: Validity Checking and Points Updating
-_cha_ge_point: Similar to _cha_point, it includes the updated XYZ coordinates, classification, and RGB color of each point after validity checks. Points in the same tree retain the same color.
-_cha_ge_lei: Contains the XYZ coordinates of the updated tree apex positions.
